<h2 style="text-align: center"> Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This project will explore the nature of the data science pipeline covering data from the National Football League(NFL). 
  The NFL is a premier sports league in the United States, with 32 teams playing 17 games a season, and more in the playoffs. 
  For years, data on each game played, score, and every play have been logged in order to break down games into their 
  statistical essence. This provides a great opportunity to understand data science concepts by exploring datasets covering NFL 
  games and examine the data with a linear regression and binary classifier ML algorithms under the Primary Analysis section.
</p>
<p>
  This analysis will cover the five stages of the data lifecycle in order to analyze the data available about NFL games played.
  As seasons pass, the NFL has evolved its season length and rulebook. Looking at data gathered over several years can provide 
  insight into how the game has changed, and we can find statistically significant outliers and trends in that time.

<p>
  I will cover the stages of the Data Lifecycle in these steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Data Curation and Preprocessing</li>
  <li>Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization</li>
  <li>Primary Analysis</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: center"> Data Curation and Preprocessing</h2>
<p>
  This section focuses on data collection, curation, and transformations to prepare our data for analysis. I searched for NFL 
  datasets that contained interesting data and hopefully with several years of observations.
</p>
<p>
  I found a dataset that provided <a href="https://github.com/nflverse/nfldata/blob/master/data/games.csv">box scores</a> across a few decades worth of games. This dataset is available for download or 
  import from github with credit to its owner nflverse. 
  I also found data across several years of team statistics, at <a href="https://github.com/edsonjaramillo/nfl-stats/tree/main/team_stats">edsonjaramillo/nfl-stats.</a> There are several categories to be 
  found in this dataset that provides insight into a teams stats over a seven year span. I chose to analyze teamsâ€™ offensive 
  passing, rushing, scoring, defensive rushing, and special teams field goals statistics. All of these can provide a rough 
  estimation of a team in a given year, and we will learn what differentiates playoff and non playoff teams.
